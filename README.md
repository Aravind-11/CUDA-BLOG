# CUDA Thrust Examples & Exercises: Mastering High-Performance Computing

Dive into high-performance parallel computing with this collection of CUDA Thrust examples and hands-on exercises designed to sharpen your skills.

## Overview

This repository isn't just a showcase of code; it's an interactive learning environment. It provides example CUDA samples using NVIDIA's Thrust library, focusing on practical scenarios like particle-based simulations. More importantly, you'll find opportunities to **execute the code, experiment, and test your understanding** of parallel computing patterns and crucial performance optimization techniques.

## Examples & Exercises

Explore the code, then put your knowledge to the test! Each example serves as a basis for exercises designed to reinforce the concepts.

### Foundational Concepts

*   **thrust_zip.cu**: Learn the basics of combining multiple data streams using Thrust's zip iterators. (_Exercise: Modify the zip operation to handle different data types._)
*   **thrust_combined.cu**: See how transform iterators work with zip iterators for efficient multi-vector operations. (_Exercise: Implement a new transformation function and apply it._)

### Advanced Performance Tuning

*   **optimized_max_displacement.cu**: Study an optimized approach using iterators to compute maximum displacement between particle sets. (_Exercise: Analyze the memory access patterns._)
*   **performance_comparison.cu**: Compare naive vs. optimized methods for particle displacement calculations. (_Exercise: Benchmark the code with varying data sizes and analyze the performance difference._)

_(Note: Specific exercises might be detailed within the code comments or accompanying materials.)_

## Key Learning Objectives: Performance Optimization

Through actively working with these examples and exercises, you will gain practical experience with vital CUDA optimization techniques, including:

1.  **Fused Operations**: Understand how transform iterators eliminate the need for temporary memory storage.
2.  **Memory Coalescing**: Learn to structure data and access patterns for optimal GPU memory bandwidth.
3.  **Work Reduction**: Practice minimizing redundant computations and memory transfers.
4.  **Algorithm Selection**: Gain insight into choosing and utilizing Thrust's highly-optimized parallel algorithms effectively.

## Requirements

To compile and run the examples and complete the exercises, you'll need:

*   CUDA Toolkit 11.0 or higher
*   A CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU
*   A C++14 compatible compiler (like `g++` or `clang++` alongside `nvcc`)

## Building and Running the Exercises

To compile an example and prepare for testing:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the source file
nvcc -std=c++14 -o <executable_name> <source_file.cu>
Use code with caution.
Markdown
Replace <executable_name> with your desired output file name (e.g., thrust_zip_test).
Replace <source_file.cu> with the example file you want to compile (e.g., thrust_zip.cu).
The -std=c++14 flag ensures compatibility with the required C++ standard.
After compiling, you can run the executable directly from your terminal:
./<executable_name>
