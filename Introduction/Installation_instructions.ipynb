    "## Installing the CUDA Toolkit and `nvcc`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nvcc.svg\" alt=\"nvcc\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To compile and run CUDA code, you need the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit installed on your system. The toolkit includes the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (`nvcc`), essential libraries, and header files (like `<cuda/std/mdspan>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The Recommended Method: Install the CUDA Toolkit**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward way to get `nvcc` and all necessary components is to install the official CUDA Toolkit from NVIDIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Go to the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Download Page:** [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)\n",
    "*   **Select your System:** Choose your Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, RHEL), architecture (e.g., x86_64), and preferred installer type (package manager recommended for ease of updates).\n",
    "*   **Follow the Provided Instructions:** NVIDIA provides detailed instructions for each system and installer type. Using your distribution's package manager (like `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu or `dnf`/`yum` for Fedora/RHEL/Rocky) is often the easiest method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Ubuntu using package manager):** The instructions might involve adding an NVIDIA repository and then running commands similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get update\n",
    "# Replace <version> e.g., cuda-toolkit-12-5\n",
    "sudo apt-get install cuda-toolkit-<version>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard installation (especially via package managers or to the default `/usr/local/cuda` location) typically sets up the necessary environment variables (`PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) automatically, so `nvcc` and its associated headers/libraries should be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Verifying the Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, open a *new* terminal window (to ensure environment variables are loaded) and check the `nvcc` version:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nvcc --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should output the compiler version information if the installation was successful and `nvcc` is in your system's `PATH`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Troubleshooting: Missing Headers (`cuda/std/mdspan`) or `nvcc` Not Found**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, especially if you have multiple CUDA versions or installed to a custom location (e.g., using Spack), the environment might not pick up the correct installation automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Problem:** Compiling code (often within a Jupyter Notebook or specific environment) fails with errors like `fatal error: cuda/std/mdspan: No such file or directory` or commands like `!nvcc ...` fail because `nvcc` isn't found.\n",
    "*   **Reason:** This usually means either the compiler isn't finding the header files from the correct CUDA Toolkit installation, or the `nvcc` executable itself isn't in the environment's `PATH`. The `<cuda/std/mdspan>` header is part of the `libcudacxx` library, which is included in modern CUDA Toolkits. ([libcudacxx documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cccl/libcudacxx/setup/getting.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Solution 1: Ensure Correct `nvcc` is in `PATH` (Especially for Notebooks)**\n",
    "    If you know where your desired CUDA Toolkit is installed, you can explicitly add its `bin` directory to the `PATH` environment variable *within your session or script/notebook*. This ensures the correct `nvcc` (and by extension, its associated environment) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example (Python/Jupyter Notebook):**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "    # --- ADJUST THIS PATH ---\n",
    "    # Example path for a CUDA installation via Spack (replace with YOUR actual path)\n",
    "    # cuda_bin_path = \"/packages/apps/spack/21/opt/spack/linux-rocky8-zen3/gcc-12.1.0/cuda-12.6.1-cf4xlcbcfpwchqwo5bktxyhjagryzcx6/bin\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Example path for a default installation (check if '/usr/local/cuda/bin' exists)\n",
    "    cuda_bin_path = \"/usr/local/cuda/bin\" # MODIFY THIS IF NEEDED\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Check if the path exists before adding\n",
    "    if os.path.isdir(cuda_bin_path):\n",
    "        # Prepend the CUDA bin path to the environment PATH if not already present\n",
    "        if cuda_bin_path not in os.environ['PATH']:\n",
    "            print(f\"Adding {cuda_bin_path} to PATH\")\n",
    "            os.environ['PATH'] = cuda_bin_path + os.pathsep + os.environ['PATH']\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(f\"{cuda_bin_path} already in PATH\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(f\"Warning: Specified CUDA bin path does not exist: {cuda_bin_path}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Optional: Verify nvcc is found now (within the notebook's context)\n",
    "    # The exact command might depend on your notebook setup (! or %sx)\n",
    "    print(\"\\nVerifying nvcc location:\")\n",
    "    !which nvcc\n",
    "    print(\"\\nVerifying nvcc version:\")\n",
    "    !nvcc --version\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **Important:** Replace the `cuda_bin_path` value with the *actual path* to the `bin` directory inside your CUDA Toolkit installation. Verify the path exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Solution 2: Explicit Include Paths (Command-Line Compilation)**\n",
    "    If compiling directly with `nvcc` on the command line and headers aren't found, you might need to explicitly tell the compiler where to look using the `-I` flag. The `libcudacxx` headers are usually in a subdirectory within the toolkit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # Example: Adjust the path '/usr/local/cuda-12.5' to your actual installation\n",
    "    # The exact path for libcudacxx headers might vary slightly between versions\n",
    "    nvcc your_code.cu -o your_executable -I/usr/local/cuda-12.5/include/\n",
    "    # Or potentially deeper for libcudacxx specifically if needed:\n",
    "    # nvcc your_code.cu -o your_executable -I/usr/local/cuda-12.5/include/libcudacxx/include/\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    *(Note: This is less common for the standard library headers like `<cuda/std/mdspan>` if `nvcc` itself is found correctly via `PATH`, but can be useful for other libraries or troubleshooting).*\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Alternative: Using NVIDIA NGC Containers**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a potentially simpler setup, consider using NVIDIA NGC containers ([https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/)). These are pre-built Docker containers with the CUDA Toolkit, drivers, and common AI/HPC frameworks already installed and configured, avoiding local installation complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Note on Linux Kernel Headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might see recommendations to install `linux-headers-$(uname -r)`. These are necessary for building kernel modules, specifically for installing the NVIDIA *driver*. While the driver is required to *run* CUDA applications, installing kernel headers doesn't directly provide the CUDA Toolkit (`nvcc`) or its C++ library headers like `mdspan`. You typically need both the driver *and* the toolkit installed. Installing the toolkit usually handles its own dependencies.\n"
